Description: Nonparametric methods for landmark prediction of long-term survival outcomes, incorporating covariate and short-term event information. The package supports the construction of flexible varying-coefficient models that use discrete covariates, as well as multiple continuous covariates.
 The goal is to improve prediction accuracy when censored short-term events are available as predictors, using robust nonparametric procedures that do not require correct model specification and avoid restrictive parametric assumptions found in alternative methods.
 More information on these methods can be found in Parast et al. 2012 <doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.721281>,
